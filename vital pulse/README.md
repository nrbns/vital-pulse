# Pulse 🩸🌍

**The world's open-source emergency blood + hospital platform**

One app that works in 150+ countries from day one.

---

When someone needs blood or is having a heart attack at 3 AM,  
there is no "India version" or "Africa version" of panic.

**Pulse is one single app that saves lives everywhere:**
- Need blood → instantly find donors + blood banks near you
- Medical emergency → nearest hospital + one-tap call/navigate
- Want to donate → camps, eligibility tracker, badges, global impact

Built to work on $20 phones and 2G networks in rural Nigeria,  
and on iPhones in New York — same codebase, same speed.
